# ScanResultList\_t Union

**Parent topic:**[MAC Data Structures](GUID-D83EFB67-1CD2-4DDB-825D-8A6090B47CA1.md)

## C

```c
typedef union {
    uint8_t edValue[5];
    WPAN_Pandescriptor_t wpanPanDesc;
} ScanResultList_t;

```

## Summary

In order to allow proper alignment of members of the PAN descriptor list in the scan confirm for non 8-bit platforms \(such as ARM\), the variable portion of scan confirm at the end of the primitive needs to be aligned to at list of WPAN\_Pandescriptor\_t.This has no impact for 8-bit platforms
