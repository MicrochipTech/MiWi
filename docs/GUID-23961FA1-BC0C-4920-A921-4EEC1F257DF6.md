## C

```c
void USR_MLME_ScanConf(uint8_t status, uint8_t ScanType,uint8_t ChannelPage, uint32_t UnscannedChannels, uint8_t ResultListSize, void *ResultList)
```

## Summary

Callback function that must be implemented by application \(NHLE\) for MAC service MLME-SCAN.confirm.

## Description

This function implemented by application \(NHLE\) for MAC service MLME-SCAN.confirm.

|ResultListSize|Number of elements in ResultList|
|ResultList|Pointer to array of scan results|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
void USR_MLME_ScanConf(uint8_t status, uint8_t ScanType,uint8_t ChannelPage, uint32_t UnscannedChannels, uint8_t ResultListSize, void *ResultList)
{
    status = status;
    ScanType = ScanType;
    ChannelPage = ChannelPage;
    UnscannedChannels = UnscannedChannels;
    ResultListSize = ResultListSize;
