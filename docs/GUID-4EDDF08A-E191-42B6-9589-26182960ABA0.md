# MiApp\_SearchConnection

|API|uint8\_t MiApp\_SearchConnection\(uint8\_t ScanDuartion, uint32\_t ChannelMap,SearchConnectionConf\_callback\_t ConfCallback\)|
|Description|This is the primary user interface function for the application layer to perform an active scan. After this function call, all active scan response is stored in the global variable ActiveScanResults in the format of structure ACTIVE\_SCAN\_RESULT. The return value indicates the total number of valid active scan response in the active scan result array.|
|Pre-Condition|Protocol initialization must be done.|
|Parameters|uint8\_t ScanDuration – maximum time to perform scan on single channel. The value is from5 to 14. The real time to perform scan can be calculated with the following formula from the IEEE802.15.4 specification:960 x \(2^ScanDuration + 1\) x 10^\(-6\) second.uint32\_t ChannelMap – bit map of channels to perform noise scan. The 32-bit double wordparameter uses one bit to represent corresponding channels from 0 to 31. For instance,0x00000003 represents to scan channel 0 and channel 1.SearchConnectionConf\_callback\_t ConfCallback – callback routine which is called whenthe initiated connection procedure is performed.|
|Returns|The number of valid active scan response stored in the global variable ActiveScanResults.|
|Example|<code\>// Perform an active scan on all possible channelsNumOfActiveScanResponse = MiApp\_SearchConnection\(10, 0xFFFFFFFF, callback\);</code\>|
|Remarks|None|
