# Starting a PAN network

The first action the next higher layer takes for starting the PAN is to reset the MAC<br /> layer. After resetting the MAC sublayer, NHLE layer is to initiate a scan to search for<br /> other PANs in the area. An active scan is required, and an ED scan may optionally be<br /> performed.

Following is the procedure for starting the PAN network,

-   Resetting the MAC Layer - **[WPAN\_MLME\_ResetReq](GUID-E48D2F16-7917-4A45-894C-7B80A33B71C8.md)**\(true\)
-   Scanning the Channels Supported \(Select the channel, PANId, Short Address based on scan results\) â€“

**[WPAN\_MLME\_ScanReq](GUID-B509C8FA-73E4-41DD-919F-053955BEB0FA.md)**\(MLME\_SCAN\_TYPE\_ACTIVE,<br /> SCAN\_CHANNEL\(current\_channel\), SCAN\_DURATION\_LONG, current\_channel\_page\)

-   Starting the network on a particular PAN ID.

Upon starting the network, Coordinator will be able to

-   Respond to beacon request frames \(active scan by another node\) with proper beacon frames.
-   Perform network realignment and transmit coordinator realignment frames \(initiated by calling function **[WPAN\_MLME\_StartReq](GUID-F06E1F1E-B885-41E1-BC72-68CDC78EF002.md)** \(\) with parameter CoordinatorRealignment = true\)

PAN Start message sequence of coordinator is depicted in the below picture,
