# WPAN\_MLME\_ScanReq Function

**Parent topic:**[Channel Scan APIs](GUID-B33CFFD6-DB3D-4314-81F1-23D388AE9F67.md)

## C

```c
bool WPAN_MLME_ScanReq(uint8_t ScanType, uint32_t ScanChannels, uint8_t ScanDuration, uint8_t ChannelPage)
```

## Summary

It initiates MLME-SCAN.request service and have it placed in the MLME-SAP queue.

## Description

This function is used to initiate a channel scan over a given list of channels.<br />A device can use a channel scan to measure the energy on the channel, search for<br />the coordinator with which it associated, or search for all coordinators transmitting<br />beacon frames within the POS of the scanning device. It initiates MLME-SCAN.request<br />service and have it placed in the MLME-SAP queue. The MLME-SCAN.request primitive is<br />used to initiate a channel scan over a given list of channels. A device can use a channel<br />scan to measure the energy on the channel, search for the coordinator with which it associated,<br />or search for all coordinators transmitting beacon frames within the POS of the scanning device.

## Precondition

WPAN\_Init\(\) should have been called before calling this function.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|ScanType|Type of scan to perform. Valid values:- @ref MLME\_SCAN\_TYPE\_ED, @ref MLME\_SCAN\_TYPE\_ACTIVE, @ref MLME\_SCAN\_TYPE\_PASSIVE, @ref MLME\_SCAN\_TYPE\_ORPHAN|
|ScanChannels|Channels to be scanned|
|ScanDuration|Duration of each scan|
|ChannelPage|The channel page on which to perform the scan|

## Returns

*true* - success;<br />*false* - buffer not available or queue full.

## Example

```c
bool retVal = false;
uint8_t current_channel = 13;
uint8_t current_channel_page = 0;
uint8_t scan_duration = 5;
retVal = WPAN_MLME_ScanReq(MLME_SCAN_TYPE_ACTIVE,
SCAN_CHANNEL(current_channel),
scan_duration,
current_channel_page);
if (true != retVal)
{
     printf("buffer not available or queue full");
}
```

## Remarks

On the receipt of WPAN\_MLME\_ScanReq, MAC layer will perform respective operation and asynchronously invokes USR\_MLME\_ScanConf with proper status.
