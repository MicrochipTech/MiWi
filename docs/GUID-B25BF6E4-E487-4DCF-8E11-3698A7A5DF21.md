# Introduction

Microchip IEEE 802.15.4 MAC API provides interface between the physical layer and the network<br /> layer. This document provides information on how to configure and enable the<br /> functionalities of the API software. A general description of each API is provided<br /> including the functionalities, syntax, responses, and an example. The API description<br /> defines the parameter with its type, range \(valid /acceptable values\), the default value<br /> \(when available\), and the factory programmed value \(when applicable\) .

The IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines the MAC \(Media Access Control\) layer<br /> for low-rate wireless personal area networks \(LR-WPANs\).

Besides that, the MAC core layer provides the set of APIs which can be<br /> used to interface a basic application.

The following building blocks of MAC Layer

-   MAC Dispatcher
-   MAC Management Service
-   MAC Data service
-   MAC Beacon Manager
-   MAC Security module
-   MAC incoming frame processor
-   MAC PIB Module
-   MAC Stack task functions

It is responsible for managing access to the shared wireless medium,<br /> handling data transmission and reception, and providing support<br /> for security and power management. The MAC layer uses a<br /> contention-based CSMA/CA \(Carrier Sense Multiple Access with<br /> Collision Avoidance\) protocol to manage access to the wireless<br /> medium
