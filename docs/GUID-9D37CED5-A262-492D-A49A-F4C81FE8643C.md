# USR\_MLME\_BeaconNotifyInd callback Function

**Parent topic:**[Beacon Notification APIs](GUID-5B2DF770-3054-4D19-B9EC-7943F6EC1253.md)

## C

```c
void USR_MLME_BeaconNotifyInd(uint8_t BSN, WPAN_Pandescriptor_t *PANDescriptor, uint8_t PendAddrSpec, uint8_t *AddrList, uint8_t sduLength, uint8_t *sdu);
```

## Summary

Callback function that must be implemented by application \(NHLE\) for MAC service MLME-BEACON-NOTIFY.indication.

## Description

This function implemented by application \(NHLE\) for MAC service MLME-BEACON-NOTIFY.indication.

## Precondition

WPAN\_Init\(\) should have been called before calling this function.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|BSN|Beacon sequence number|
|PANDescriptor|Pointer to PAN descriptor for received beacon|
|PendAddrSpec|Pending address specification in received beacon|
|AddrList|List of addresses of devices the coordinator has pending data|
|sduLength|Length of beacon payload|
|sdu|Pointer to beacon payload|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
void USR_MLME_BeaconNotifyInd(uint8_t BSN, WPAN_Pandescriptor_t *PANDescriptor, uint8_t PendAddrSpec, uint8_t *AddrList, uint8_t sduLength, uint8_t *sdu);

{
     DeviceAddress = DeviceAddress;
     CapabilityInformation = CapabilityInformation;
}
```

## Remarks

There is weak function for this callback. User has to define own implementation for required operation on the reception of particular callback.
