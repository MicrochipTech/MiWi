# Overview

The MiWi Development Environment \(MiWi DE\) was developed by Microchip to<br /> support a wide range of wireless applications. The backbone of MiWi DE is MiMAC and<br /> MiApp interfaces, which links the support of multiple RF transceivers and wireless<br /> communication protocols together as a well-defined, simple but robust Microchip<br /> proprietary wireless development environment.

Within MiWi DE, application developers can switch between RF transceivers and<br /> wireless protocols with little or no modification in the application layer. Such<br /> migration capability in MiWi DE reduces the firmware development risk to a very minimum<br /> level. MiWi DE is defined by three layers:

-   Application layer
-   Protocol layer
-   RF transceiver layer

The three layers are linked together by MiMAC and MiApp interfaces. The<br /> Application layer uses MiApp interfaces to communicate to the protocol layer. In the<br /> protocol layer, there are implementations of MiWi P2P, MiWi Star, and MiWi Mesh wireless<br /> communication protocols. The drivers for Microchip RF transceivers \(AT86RF233,<br /> AT86RF212B\) are called by protocol layers via MiMAC interfaces. Configuration files are<br /> also presented in each layer.

The MiWi stack offers a significantly smaller footprint relative to the open<br /> standard based ZigBee® compliant protocol stack. This enables operation in<br /> microcontrollers with smaller memory/lower cost.

-   MiWi P2P/Star – Simple Peer-to-Peer or Star network requiring minimal code size.
-   MiWi Mesh – A True Routing Mesh network topology. This can be used for a department store HVAC, alarm application or a large smart home application.
