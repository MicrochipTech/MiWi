# WPAN\_MLME\_DisassociateReq Function

**Parent topic:**[Disassociation APIs](GUID-6FE28373-B7C9-4A15-B1B8-390B864120B2.md)

## C

```c
bool WPAN_MLME_DisassociateReq(WPAN_AddrSpec_t *DeviceAddrSpec, uint8_t DisassociateReason, bool TxIndirect)
```

## Summary

Inititate MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request service and have it placed in the MLME-SAP queue.

## Description

This function is used by the associated device to notify the coordinator of its intent to leave the PAN.<br />It is also used by the coordinator to instruct an associated device to leave the PAN.<br />The MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request primitive is used by an associated device to notify the<br />coordinator of its intent to leave the PAN. It is also used by the coordinator to<br />instruct an associated device to leave the PAN.

## Precondition

WPAN\_Init\(\) should have been called before calling this function.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|DeviceAddrSpec|Pointer to WPAN\_AddrSpec\_t structure for device to which to send the disassociation notification command|
|DisassociateReason|DisassociateReason\* - Reason for disassociation. Valid values: - @ref WPAN\_DISASSOC\_BYPARENT, @ref WPAN\_DISASSOC\_BYCHILD|
|TxIndirect|TRUE if the disassociation notification command is to be sent indirectly|

## Returns

*true* - success;<br />*false* - buffer not available or queue full.

## Example

```c
WPAN_AddrSpec_t DeviceAddrSpec;
DeviceAddrSpec.AddrMode = WPAN_ADDRMODE_SHORT;
DeviceAddrSpec.PANId = 0x1111;
DeviceAddrSpec.Addr.shortAddress = 0x0001;
uint16_t DisassociateReason = WPAN_DISASSOC_BYCHILD;
bool TxIndirect = true;

bool retVal = false;
retVal = WPAN_MLME_DisassociateReq(&DeviceAddrSpec, WPAN_DISASSOC_BYCHILD, true);
if (true != retVal)
{
     printf("buffer not available or queue full");
}
```

## Remarks

On the receipt of WPAN\_MLME\_DisassociateReq, MAC layer will perform respective operation and asynchronously invokes USR\_MLME\_DisassociateConf with proper status.
