# MiApp\_NoiseDetection

|API|uint8\_t MiApp\_NoiseDetection\( uint32\_t ChannelMap, uint8\_t ScanDuration,uint8\_t DetectionMode, uint8\_t NoiseLevel\)|
|Description|This is the primary user interface function for the application layer to perform noise detection on multiple channels.|
|Pre-Condition|Protocol initialization is done.|
|Parameters|uint32\_t ChannelMap – bit map of channels to perform a noise scan. The 32-bit doubleword parameter uses one bit to represent corresponding channels from 0 to 31. For example,0x00000003 represents to scan channel 0 and channel 1.• uint8\_t ScanDuration – maximum time to perform a scan on a single channel. The validvalue is from 5 to 14. The real time to perform a scan can be calculated in the followingformula from IEEE 802.15.4 specification:960 x \(2^ScanDuration + 1\) x 10^\(-6\) second• uint8\_t DetectionMode – the noise detection mode to perform the scan. The twopossible scan modes are as following.– NOISE\_DETECT\_ENERGY – Energy detection scan mode– NOISE\_DETECT\_CS – Carrier sense detection scan mode• uint8\_t NoiseLevel - noise level at the channel with least noise level|
|Returns|The channel that has the lowest noise level.|
|Example|<code\>uint8\_t NoiseLevel;OptimalChannel = MiApp\_NoiseDetection\(0xFFFFFFFF, 10, NOISE\_DETECT\_ENERGY,&NoiseLevel\);</code\>|
|Remarks|None|
